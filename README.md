## Introduction

The Web Page Widget is used to display other web pages inside of a Presentation. The page can be shifted by setting the Horizontal Scroll and Vertical Scroll values. This functions in the same way as a scrollbar does on a regular web page, allowing the Widget to display only a specific region. The page can also be scaled to a desired amount between 50% - 200% and has the option of enabling or disabling interactivity with the web page.

The Widget refreshes the page as per the Data Refresh Interval. To prevent it from displaying a cached copy, a dummy variable is appended to the URL with every update, forcing the Web Page Widget to show the most recent version of the web page.

Web Page Widget works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.
